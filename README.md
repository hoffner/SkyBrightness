# SkyBrightness

ArcGIS Survey123 survey for taking sky brightness measurements

##What is Survey123?

Survey123, part of ESRI's ArcGIS suite of tools, allows you to create surveys that integrate spatial data and work well on mobile devices. You can learn more about it at [survey123.arcgis.com](http://survey123.arcgis.com).

##What does this do?

This survey records the submit date and time, username, location, sky quality meter type and number, and 3-5 meter readings. Behind the scenes, it also computes the average of all readings and records that too. Each survey response is added to a web map in ArcGIS Online.

##How can I use this survey?

To make your own copy of this survey, just clone this repository to your local `My Survey Designs` directory, open it in Survey123 Connect, and publish it through your ArcGIS Online account. You will then be able to download it from within the Survey123 app for your mobile (or desktop) platform of choice. Although your use case will probably not be identical, I hope that at least some of the underlying XLSForm setup for this survey will be useful.
